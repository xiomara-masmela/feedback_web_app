# Feedback

This is my second project for the Back End unit, part of my SE flexible Software Engineering course with General Assembly. 

Feedback is an app that Students on Web Design/Development can use  to post their work and receive feedback from peers. Feedback from peers and seniors is an important step to improve our skills and to have better projects to present as Designers/Developers.

The idea is to promote collaboration for Designer/Developers that need to build a portfolio or want to help junior Designers/Developers. Even if for a project, a Developer can find a Design from another student and collaborate to build the project.

Each user, once logged in will have the funcionality to upload, edit and delete their projects, as well as post comments on the projects wihin the app.
